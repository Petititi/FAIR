# FAIR
binarization algorithm

The FAIR algorithm has been submitted to different contests where it showed good performance in comparison to the state of the art. In addition, this method is scale invariant and fast enough to be used in real-time applications.
You will find more details in our article: [FAIR: a Fast Algorithm for document Image Restoration](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=6482566).
